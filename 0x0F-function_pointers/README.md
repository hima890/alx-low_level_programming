# Function Pointers and Basic Calculations

In this series of programming tasks, we explore the concept of function pointers and use them to perform various calculations. Each task highlights a different aspect of working with function pointers and demonstrates their flexibility in solving problems.

## Task 0: What's my name

In this task, we start by writing a function that prints a name. The function accepts a name as a string and a function pointer, allowing us to customize how the name is printed. This demonstrates the versatility of function pointers in controlling the behavior of a function.

## Task 1: If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done

Next, we create a function that iterates through an array and applies a given function to each element. The function pointer is used to define the action performed on each element of the array, providing flexibility in processing data.

## Task 2: To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities

In this task, we implement a function that searches for an integer in an array. We use a function pointer to determine the matching criteria for the search. The function returns the index of the first matching element, offering a powerful way to search for specific elements in an array.

## Task 3: A goal is not always meant to be reached; it often serves simply as something to aim at

For the final task, we build a program that performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input. This program uses function pointers to select the appropriate operation, allowing us to perform calculations with ease.
