# Function Pointers and Basic Calculations

In this series of programming tasks, we explore the concept of function pointers and use them to perform various calculations. Each task highlights a different aspect of working with function pointers and demonstrates their flexibility in solving problems.

## Task 0: What's my name

In this task, we start by writing a function that prints a name. The function accepts a name as a string and a function pointer, allowing us to customize how the name is printed. This demonstrates the versatility of function pointers in controlling the behavior of a function.

## Task 1: If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done

Next, we create a function that iterates through an array and applies a given function to each element. The function pointer is used to define the action performed on each element of the array, providing flexibility in processing data.

## Task 2: To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities

In this task, we implement a function that searches for an integer in an array. We use a function pointer to determine the matching criteria for the search. The function returns the index of the first matching element, offering a powerful way to search for specific elements in an array.

## Task 3: A goal is not always meant to be reached; it often serves simply as something to aim at

For the final task, we build a program that performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input. This program uses function pointers to select the appropriate operation, allowing us to perform calculations with ease.



Certainly, here's the readme file without any code for the program that prints the opcodes of its own `main` function:

# Main Opcode Printer

This program is designed to print the opcodes of its own `main` function. You can specify the number of bytes of opcodes you want to print by providing the argument `number_of_bytes` when running the program. The output will display the opcodes in hexadecimal format, lowercase, with two characters for each opcode, separated by spaces.

## Usage

To use this program, follow these instructions:

1. Compile the program without any specific compilation flags.

2. Run the program with the desired number of bytes for the opcodes.

For example, to print the first 21 bytes of the `main` function's opcodes.

## Output Format

The opcodes will be printed in hexadecimal format, with each opcode represented as two characters, separated by spaces. The output will end with a newline.

## Error Handling

The program includes error handling for the following cases:

1. If the number of arguments provided is incorrect, it will display an error message and exit with status 1.

2. If the number of bytes specified is negative, it will display an error message and exit with status 2.

## Note

The specific opcodes generated by the program may vary depending on how you write the `main` function and the machine you compile the program on. You can use tools like `udcli` to translate the opcodes into assembly instructions for further analysis.

To translate opcodes to assembly instructions using `udcli`, you can use a command like this:

Replace `<address>` with the address where the `main` function is located.
