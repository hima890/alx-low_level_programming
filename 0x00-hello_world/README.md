6. run command optaions gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 

**Files:-**
1. Write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.

2. a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.

3. a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.

4. a C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.

5. a C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line.

6. a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

You should produce the exact same output as in the example
Warnings are allowed
