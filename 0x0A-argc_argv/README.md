# 0x0A. argc, argv - C Programming

## Description

This repository contains C programs that utilize command-line arguments (`argc` and `argv`) in C programming. Each program serves a specific purpose, demonstrating how to handle command-line arguments effectively.

---

## Task 0: What's Your Name

**Program**: `0-whatsmyname.c`

This program prints its name, followed by a new line. If you rename the program, it will print the new name without recompilation. The program retains the path information in the name.

---

## Task 1: Silence is Argument

**Program**: `1-args.c`

This program prints the number of arguments passed into it. It prints a number, followed by a new line.

---

## Task 2: The Best Argument

**Program**: `2-args.c`

This program prints all the arguments it receives, with each argument on a separate line, including the first one.

---

## Task 3: Neither Irony Nor Sarcasm

**Program**: `3-mul.c`

This program multiplies two numbers and prints the result, followed by a new line. It can handle positive, negative, and zero values. If the program does not receive two arguments, it prints "Error" and returns 1.

---

## Task 4: To Infinity and Beyond

**Program**: `4-add.c`

This program adds positive numbers and prints the result, followed by a new line. If no numbers are passed, it prints "0." If any argument contains symbols that are not digits, it prints "Error" and returns 1.

---

These C programs demonstrate various aspects of working with command-line arguments in C programming. Each program provides a specific functionality and showcases how to handle different scenarios related to command-line arguments.
