# C Preprocessor - Tasks

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate the use of the C preprocessor and macro definitions.

## Task 0: Object-like Macro

Create a header file named `0-object_like_macro.h` that defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.

## Task 1: Pi

Create a header file named `1-pi.h` that defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.

## Task 2: File Name

Write a program (2-main.c) that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.

## Task 3: Function-like Macro

Create a function-like macro named `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.

## Task 4: SUM

Create a function-like macro named `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`.

These tasks demonstrate various aspects of using macros and the C preprocessor to simplify code and perform computations. The header files (`0-object_like_macro.h`, `1-pi.h`, `3-function_like_macro.h`, and `4-sum.h`) contain the macro definitions for their respective tasks.
